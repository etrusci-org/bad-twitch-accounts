# Bad Twitch Accounts

Twitch accounts we banned because of various reasons. Mostly spam and lurker bots.

All entries are added manually by either me or my mods and are not scraped from existing lists.

- [command.txt](list/command.txt): ready to use `/ban`command.
- [plain.txt](list/plain.txt): only the usernames.
